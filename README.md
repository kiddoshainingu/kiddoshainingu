Curiosity led me to discover **Ruby** via Code School, never stopped using it ever since !

Thanks to the professional environment, I got to learn **React**, and more recently **Flutter**.

Furthermore, an article headline caught my attention. Stating *Â«Â Elixir made me a better RubyistÂ Â»*.  
Built interest in **Elixir** / **Phoenix**. Currently working on a Tekken related project for more than a year now.

I like to think that programming is an art form in which anyone can express themselves to solve a common problem.

So yeah... You can call me an (Elixir / Ruby / React / Flutter) artist. ðŸ¥³
